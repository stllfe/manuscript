# this module will provide a utility for patching a given script
# automatically swapping variables with the values from CLI
# so this makes a CLI-configured script a regular python file with correctly baked-in values.

# TODO: Implement more sophisticated patching that replaces the configurable
# section with hardcoded values while preserving the rest of the script
